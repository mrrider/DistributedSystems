Hey, 

Here is my implementation of the Client-Server application for Replicated Log task. 
I choose python + FastApi to develop this. 
It’s my first application on python, so maybe it’s not perfectly written. 
I just choose random interesting for me technologies. 
Also, maybe I will need python knowledge in future courses on this program.

## Appendix

I am working with a very specific programming language(C/AL and AL) and .net a bit. 
I don’t want to work only with these technologies and want to learn new languages. 
I remember that you told us not to use new language in this project in parallel, but I decided to try.
Hope it will not cause problems
